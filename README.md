## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (or a connection to a MongoDB Atlas cloud database)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rakeshdas07/CSE_IIITG.git
   cd CSE_IIITG
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/hostel_mess_management
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

   - `PORT`: Port number the server will listen on.
   - `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string.
   - `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT authentication.

4. **Run the Application**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Seed Database (Optional)


```bash
npm run seed
